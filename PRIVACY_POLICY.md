Welcome to DigiFarmacy. This application is a professional tool designed exclusively for use by licensed pharmacists and laboratory personnel in Sri Lanka. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in the context of our services.

## 2. Scope of this Policy

This policy applies to all users of the DigiFarmacy application, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and authorized laboratory staff.

## 3. Information We Do NOT Collect

To protect privacy and comply with healthcare regulations, DigiFarmacy is designed to be a stateless tool. We do **not** collect, store, or process any of the following types of data:

*   **Patient-Identifiable Information:** We do not collect names, National Identity Card (NIC) numbers, addresses, contact details, or any other personal information of patients.
*   **Clinical Data:** We do not store any medical history, diagnosis, or prescription details. The prescription audit feature processes images ephemerally and does not save them or their content after the analysis is returned to the pharmacist.
*   **Personal Health Information (PHI):** The application is architected to avoid the handling and storage of PHI.

## 4. Information We Collect

We collect a limited amount of information necessary for the functioning of the application and for maintaining the security and integrity of our services.

This information is used for account verification, authentication, and communication purposes.
*   **Usage Data:** We may collect anonymous, aggregated data about how the application is used (e.g., feature usage frequency, crash reports) to improve the user experience. This data is not linked to any individual user's specific activities.

## 5. How We Use Information

*   **To Provide Services:** We use your account information to provide you with access to the application's features, such as the drug information database and prescription audit tool.
*   **To Maintain Security:** We use login credentials and session information to protect your account and prevent unauthorized access.
*   **To Improve Our Application:** Anonymous usage data helps us understand which features are most valuable and where we can make improvements.

## 6. Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect the limited information we do collect. All communications with our servers are encrypted using TLS/SSL. Access to our systems is strictly controlled.

## 7. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, or share your professional account information with third parties for marketing purposes. We may only disclose information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.
